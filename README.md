# 📊 Data Visualization Final Project – Heart Attack Visualization

This project is a final report for my data visualization course, focusing on exploring and communicating insights using Python's visualization ecosystem.

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this report is to analyze and visualize trends in the [Heart Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmohammadinia/heart-attack-dataset-tarik-a-rashid), with an emphasis on identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships through clear, effective plots.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Altair

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- A set of interactive charts to visualize gender distribution and the rate of heart attacks
- A line chart for increasing heart attacks based on Age
- Scatter plot for increased internal metrics to measure heart attacks

## 🔍 Key Insights
[Summarize 2–3 findings that came from the visuals:]
- There are many more cases of heart attacks for Males than Females.
- The increase of `Troponin` or `CK-MB` would typically result in a heart attack.
